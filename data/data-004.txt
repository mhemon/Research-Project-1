Rain delayed the toss in the T20 World Cup semi-final between defending champions England and India in Guyana on Thursday. A pre-match downpour had stopped by the time the toss should have taken place at 1400 GMT but the pitch and square remained fully covered. Wednesday's first semi-final in Trinidad, in which South Africa hammered Afghanistan by nine wickets, had a reserve day set aside in the event of rain. But the England v India game, taking place during a traditionally wet period of the year, has only 250 minutes of extra time set aside to ensure a result. India have yet lose a match at the 20-over tournament but the only Test side that England have defeated on their way to the last four are co-hosts the West Indies.
