By becoming the first South African men's captain to reach a World Cup final, Aiden Markram has proved that he and his men are cut from a different cloth. It's a personal and individual motivation that you get to a final, to earn the opportunity to hopefully lift the trophy. But we all understand (as a team) this game and how it works and how things can go for you, things can go against you, and you take that in your stride. With measure and poise at the post-match press conference after their victory against Afghanistan, and reflecting on just "another game of cricket", you'd never think Aiden Markram, moments after an ICC Men's T20 World Cup semi-final, had just become the first South Africa men's captain to take the Proteas to the promised land of a World Cup final.
