Australia's Glenn Maxwell will take an indefinite mental and physical break from the IPL after struggling for form with Royal Challengers Bengaluru. The big-hitting all-rounder has scored just 32 with the bat in six games and skipped the defeat on Monday in a record run-fest against Sunrisers Hyderabad. It was Bengaluru's sixth defeat in seven matches and Faf du Plessis's side are bottom of the 10-team table. Maxwell, who will be key for Australia at the T20 World Cup in June, was one of the first cricketers to recognise mental health issues and took a break from international cricket in 2019.
